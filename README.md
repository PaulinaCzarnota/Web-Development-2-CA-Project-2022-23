This repository contains my final Continuous Assessment project for the Web Development 2 module, completed in the second year of my Computer Science degree at **TU Dublin**.

## Project Overview

I developed a dynamic **Book Reservation Website** that allows users to:
- **Search** for available library books
- **Reserve** books through a simple and intuitive interface

The website is built with:
- **HTML** & **CSS** for a responsive, user-friendly front end
- **PHP** for server-side processing
- **MySQL** (managed with **phpMyAdmin** on **XAMPP**) for efficient data storage and retrieval

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **Reservation System**: Reserve books with a click and view current reservations.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL to store book and user data securely.
